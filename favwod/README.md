# FavWOD 
FavWOD is an app I built to keep track of some of my favorite CrossFit WODs. 

Currently when I complete a WOD that I enjoy, I have no easy way to go back at a later date to redo the WOD as I have no way to easily view just the WODs that I like. With this app my aim is to provide a place that I can enter those wods so I can view them and redo them as I wish.
